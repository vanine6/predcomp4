#Comparison of prediction algorithms and parameters for the Iris dataset.


This application is based on the Machine Learning Course. The course project consisted of applying prediction algorithms with a variety of parameters and methods in order to find out which combination of these artifacts is more appropriate for the input data set. The dataset was a measurement from wearable devices when someone was practicing exercises in some classes of execution (just one correct among 5 classes).


Therefore, based on this interesting problem, I decided to develop an application that permits the user to choose parameters, methods and algorithms, process the data partition to separate train and test data set, run the train algorithm and finally generate the results. 
The user analyzes these results and after some interactions varying the input values, determine one or more good solutions for the prediction.


I used the Iris database instead the original dataset because the latter is too big, which causes a long time to run the train algorithms in a simple machine.


The files in this branch are:

 Doc.Rmd - contains the documentation.

 UI.R - The shiny code for the user interface module.

 server.R - the shiny code for the application server.
